# PIXIT 🎨📊  
An open-source, interactive **Algorithm Visualizer** built to help users understand how sorting and pathfinding algorithms work through real-time animations and user-controlled inputs.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧭 Explore **pathfinding algorithms** like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and A*
- 🖱️ Interactive grid with obstacle placement and speed control
- 🌓 Light/Dark mode toggle
- ⚡ Smooth and responsive UI built with React

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context / useReducer / UseContext
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and dynamic DOM manipulation

## 🧠 Algorithms Visualized
